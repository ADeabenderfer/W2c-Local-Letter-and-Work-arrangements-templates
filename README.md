# W2c-Local-Letter/Work arrangements-templates
1) Local letter template provided with a W2C
2) Work arrangement letters provided to employees reflecting their work arrangements

Analysts were previously using Word document templates.

Issues:
Analysts would forget to save a copy prior to making updates / 
Locating the sections needing updated was timely (especially when original template was overridden) / 
Updates occasionally changed formatting of the word doc template

Solution:
Locating fields to be updated is easier / 
Easier to remove previously used data / 
Formatting does not accidentally get changed
